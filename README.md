The notebook can be found whith this Readme file.

The csv files are present inside another folder called 'Data', as it was provided to us. Please keep this as is to preserve the file path within the notebook. 

Ensure the file path, file name and csv file formats (like feature names) are maintained the same as the files provided to us.

You can run each column separately or all of them at once. 

If the file format isn't changed, all the cells in the notebook should work properly. 

Please ensure you install the required library packages to import and use them in the notebook.
----------------------------------------------------------
The initial activities like opening files, cleaning data, removing null values, exracting features etc. are done through functions that are defined in the cell after the imports.

All the adjustable parameters used have been assigned via variables with matching and understandable naming. You can adjust these variables accordingly as long as they make sense.

Thank you!
